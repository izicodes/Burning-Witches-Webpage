# Burning Witches Website
The band website for Burning Witches 🧙🏾‍♀️ This was the very first proper website I built 2 years ago and I found it again to upload it onto my GitHub! Burning Witches were my favourite band back then so I decided to dedicate a project to them! 🤗

## About the project 🤩
There are three pages: Home, Store and About. 
- **Home:** shows the tour dates that the band will be playing
- **Store:** items that fans can buy from Burning Witches and, *with the use of JavaScript*, you can add items to the cart and the price total amount will be calculated automatically!
- **About:** just a quick summary of who Burning Witches are

Also included a footer where all their socials are and linked to the sites!
